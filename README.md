# ALX Project: C - Binary trees
------------



At the core of this project is __Binary trees__ and its applications. All through the project; __binary__,__tree traversal__,__binary search__, __max binary heap trees__ were implemented. I gained a deep understanding about their implemetations and usage.

* __Binary trees__ provide a flexible and efficient structure for organizing and manipulating data, making them valuable in a wide range of applications.

* __Binary trees__ are hierarchical data structures that consist of __nodes__. Each __node__ in a __binary tree__ contains a value and has at most __two child nodes__: a __left child__ and a __right child__. The __left child node__ is smaller than the __parent node__, while the __right child node__ is greater. This property makes __binary trees__ useful for efficient __searching__, __insertion__, and __deletion__ operations.


## Project requirement :toolbox::ballot_box_with_check:
------

a) All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

b) The binary trees code must use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

c) No more than 5 functions per file.

d) The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called __binary_trees.h__. 

e) The header files(`binary_trees.h`) should be include guarded and pushed.
